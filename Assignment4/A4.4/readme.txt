Since only tunnel height need to be minimized, minimum spanning tree can be used to ensure maximum height for each path. The minimum spanning tree will only select edges with highest height value. This MST is also computed using Prim's algorithm. After all the edges has been computed, the graph is rebuilt only using the required edges for MST. 
For each user inputs, the program will use DFS to compute the path required to reach destination from source. After destination has been reached, it will traverse back to check the heights along the used path and get the vertex which are included in the path. By checking the heights, it can keep track of minimum height of the used path.
