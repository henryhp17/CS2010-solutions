Since the graph is a directed acyclic graph, topological sorting is used to compute the longest and shortest path efficiently. Using topological sorting, it is possible to process all the vertex in linear time complexity. After sorting all the vertices into stack, they are moved to an array so that the path searching process can be done easily by using index.
There are two different functions, one to compute shortest path and one to compute longest path, but they have the same general algorithm. BFS with DP is used to traverse the sorted vertices and when it reached an end point, it will compare the distance and get the desired distance.
